# About

I'm Johan van der Knijff, and I'm working as a digital preservation researcher/analyst. This website collects the blogs on digital preservation and file formats that I've written since 2010. Most of these are re-posts of blogs that were originally published elsewhere (mostly the [Open Preservation Foundation](href="https://openpreservation.org/) website and the [KB Research blog](http://blog.kbresearch.nl/)). Upcoming blog posts will also be published here.

If you experience any problems with this site, you can [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/bitsgalore/bitsgalore.github.io/issues).
