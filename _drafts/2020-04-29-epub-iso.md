Earlier this year the [ISO Technical Committee on Document description and processing languages](https://www.iso.org/committee/45374.html) published the new standard "Digital publishing — EPUB3 preservation" (ISO/IEC TS 22424). The standard is made up of 2 parts, which are sold as separate documents on the ISO website:

1. [Part 1: Principles (ISO/IEC TS 22424-1:2020)](https://www.iso.org/standard/73163.html)

2. [Part 2: Metadata requirements ISO/IEC TS 22424-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/73169.html)

As I didn't have access to the final as-published versions of the documents, this review is based on a combination of the (non-paywalled) preview documents on the ISO website, and a pre-publication "Final text" from September 2019.

## Part 1 - Principles

According to the information on the ISO website, "The ISO/IEC TS 22424 series supports long-term preservation of EPUB publications via a dual strategy". Even though the full standard documents are behind a paywall, a [free preview of Part 1 is available here](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:ts:22424:-1:ed-1:v1:en). It contains the introductory chapter, as well as the full table of contents.

### Purpose and scope

The introductory chapter clearly defines the purpose of this part of the standard:

> This document facilitates the long-term preservation of EPUB publications by specifying in general level EPUB features which are mandatory for long-term preservation (such as font embedding) and features which should be avoided if possible.
>
> This document can be seen as a stepping stone towards a detailed specification which would be related to EPUB in the same way as PDF/A, specified in ISO 19005-1 to ISO 19005-3, is related to the Portable Document Format (PDF).

This suggests that the purpose of Part 1 of the standard is to devise a "preservation-friendly" EPUB profile, analogous to the [PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) profiles for the PDF format.

According to the authors, long-term preservation requires:

1. making the object such as \[sic\] EPUB publication fit for preservation, including features to be used and features to avoid;
2. packaging the object (and any metadata related to it) together with any additional data such as other versions of the object and other documentation into an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) submission information package (SIP).

They then write that "packaging is covered in ISO/IEC TS 22424-2" (Part 2 of the standard).

### Part 1 is actually about packaging

Imagine my surprise then when I found the two main chapters of Part 1 to be titled "Packaging standards" (with a discussion of [OAIS Information Packages](https://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=2.2.3_INFORMATION_PACKAGE_VARIANTS)), and "Construction of OAIS information packages". The latter chapter contains an exhaustive list of requirements and recommendations on how EPUB documents should be packaged in an OAIS Submission Information Package (SIP). So, on the surface it looks like the content that is supposed to be in Part 2 of the standard (packaging) somehow ended up in Part 1 instead!

### Oh wait, there's some stuff about EPUB features as well!

However, a more in-depth look reveals that the generic packaging requirements (which are unrelated to EPUB) are mixed with requirements that actually *are* specific to EPUB. For example, section 6.2.1 ("EPUB publications SHALL be sent to a repository system as well‐formed and complete Submission Information Packages") lists requirements on validity against the EPUB specification, font embedding, multimedia content, remote resources and encryption. Confusingly, these are merrily interspersed with other requirements on descriptive metadata and submission agreements. This is not particularly helpful, given that the creation of EPUB files and SIPs are typically done at different stages of a publisher's production workflow. Also, it largely obscures what the preservation-friendly EPUB profile is actually about. Moreover, most of the packaging-related requirements and recommendations mentioned here are totally unrelated to EPUB, and would apply generically to any given format. This makes me wonder why these are even part of this standard (which, after all, is EPUB-specific).

## Part 2 - Metadata requirements

For Part 2, there is again a [free preview](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:73169:en) with an introductory chapter and the full table of contents.

### Purpose and scope

The introduction defines the purpose of this part of the standard as follows:

> This document facilitates the long-term preservation of EPUB publications by specifying metadata elements which are required or recommended for long-term preservation (such as identifiers) and the ways in which the EPUB publication and related metadata can be packaged. EPUB versions 3 and 3.0.1 are covered; if necessary, the EPUB version applicable is specified.

So, this suggests this is all about metadata and packaging. In the "Scope" section the authors also say this:

> This document makes EPUB compliant with current practices of Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) archives and technical requirements of repository systems. The former tend to rely on OAIS in their operations; the latter prefer to ingest electronic documents only in containers conforming to standards such as METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard).

This statement is remarkable, since OAIS does not include any requirements about file formats, so the concept of "OAIS-compliant" file formats is meaningless.

### No EPUB 3.2!

It is worth noting here that the introduction explicitly mentions that the current standard only covers EPUB 3 and EPUB 3.0.1 (which was published in 2014). It does not cover the current EPUB 3.2, but it does mention that this version will be covered in the next edition of the standard[^1]. This is surprising, given that EPUB 3.2 was already published in May 2019. It also means that the standard was already outdated at its date of publication.

### SIP-level metadata vs EPUB-level metadata

The main body of Part 2 contains requirements related to various types of metadata. For example, Chapter 6 covers "Packaging metadata", which the authors describe as follows:

> This chapter covers mainly metadata about the SIP (container) which is usually submitted using METS elements and attributes.

However, it turns out that some sections within this chapter are actually about metadata *within* EPUB files. Examples are section 6.6 ("Core media type resource identifiers"), which defines requirements on identifiers used in the EPUB manifest (which is part of the EPUB file) file, and section 6.7 ("Foreign resource identifiers").

Things get even worse in the sections that follow. Section 7.2 ("Technical metadata") states:

> EPUB version used SHALL be specified in the package element of the EPUB publication’s content.opf file.

Again, this applies to an EPUB's internal metadata, *not* the SIP-level metadata. Moreover, this requirement is already covered by the EPUB format specification ('version' is a mandatory attribute of an EPUB 3 Package Document), and Part 1 of ISO/IEC TS 22424 (which requires that EPUBs are conformant against the format's specification). The same applies to section 7.4 ("Structural metadata"), which says:

> EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) SHALL be used to describe the structure of \[sic\] EPUB publication.

Again, the EPUB format specification already makes this mandatory, so why is this even included in this standard?

### OAIS packages (again!)

The final two chapters of Part 2 are about the structure and content of OAIS Submission Information Packages. But OAIS information packages are already discussed at length in Part 1 (even though that discussion probably shouldn't be there to begin with!), so why is this subject even revisited here?

## Conclusion

- It seems that much of the effort behind packaging/metadata reqs is driven by expectation that EPUBs will need to be migrated to something else in the future
- Much of these are also generic, and not unique to EPUB.
- In any case, seems really specific to institutional policies, should this even be included? If yes, needs *much* better structuring. Introduction suggests strict separation of reqs that apply to EPUBs and reqs that apply to packages/metadata *which would makes sense), in reality both are mixed across both standards for no obvious reason.
- Wouldn't community be better served with some actual published METS profiles for EPUB (e.g. [see here](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/mets-registered-profiles.html))
- Also some EPUB-specific reqs already mandated by EPUB spec!
- Lack of editorial overview, as most problem apparent after even cursory read.
- Published standard does not do what it says on the tin!
- Archive-safe EPUB profile (cf PDF/A) would be useful, but needs more work. Should probably also cover some metadata aspects now covered by part 2.
- Also please let's do this in an OPEN way, not by some arcane ISO-guided process that buries the result behind a paywall; current standard could have been MUCH better quality with community involvement.  
- Standard says nothing about validation against archival profile; could be done with EPUBCheck + Schematron;  already [some work done during SCAPE project]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2015/03/13/policy-based-assessment-of-epub-with-epubcheck).

[^1]: EPUB 3.1 is not covered either, but this is understandable, since this version was never supported by any reader or validation software.
