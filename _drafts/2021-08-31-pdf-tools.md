Problems with PDF files are a recurring theme in my daily work. Over the years, I've been using a variety of open-source software tools for solving such problems. These include tools for validation and error-checking, the extraction of (technical) features and metadata, text and image extraction, to name but a few. Many of these are tools that I only use occasionally, so I often find myself forgetting how to use them (if I even remember what tool to use at all!). So, I thought it would be useful to document my go-to PDF tools and commands for a variety of common tasks in one single place, similar to [my 2015 post on preserving optical media from the command-line]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2015/11/13/preserving-optical-media-from-the-command-line). This post is first attempt at this. For now it is largely based on a number of unpublished lists, cheat-sheets and working notes that I've compiled earlier. I expect this will be very much a "living" document, and that I will add more content over time.
