Problems with PDF files are a recurring theme in my daily work. Over the years, I've been using a variety of open-source software tools for solving such problems. These include tools for validation and error-checking, the extraction of (technical) features and metadata, text and image extraction, to name but a few. Many of these are tools that I only use occasionally, so I often find myself forgetting how to use them (if I even remember what tool to use at all!). So, I thought it would be useful to document my go-to PDF tools and commands for a variety of common tasks in one single place, similar to [my 2015 post on preserving optical media from the command-line]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2015/11/13/preserving-optical-media-from-the-command-line).

This post is first attempt at this. For now it is largely based on a number of unpublished lists, cheat-sheets and working notes that I compiled earlier. I expect this will be very much a "living" document, and that I will add more content over time. All of the tools presented here are published as open-source, and most of them have a command-line interface.

## Disclaimer

I would like to stress that the selection of tasks and tools presented here is by no means meant to be exhaustive, as it is guided to a great degree by the PDF-related issues I've encountered myself in my day to day work. Some of these tasks could be done using other tools (including ones that are not mentioned here), and in some cases these other tools may well be better choices! So there's probably a fair amount of selection bias here, and I don't want to make any claims of presenting the "best" way to do any of these tasks here. Also, many of the example commands in this post can be further refined to particular needs (e.g. using additional options or alternative output formats), and they should probably best seen as (hopefully useful) starting points for the reader's own explorations.

## PDF multi-tools

Before diving into any specific tasks, I'll start this post by listing a number of general-purpose PDF tools and toolkits. Each of these are capable of a wide range of tasks (including some that I won't explicitly address in this post), and they can be seen as "Swiss army-knives" of PDF processing. Whenever I need to get some PDF processing or analysis done and I'm not sure what tool to use, these are usually my starting point. In the majority of cases, at least one of them turns out to have the functionality I'm looking for, so it's a good idea to check them out if you're not familiar with them already.

### Xpdf/Poppler

[Xpdf](https://www.xpdfreader.com/) and [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) are both PDF viewers that include a collection of tools for processing and manipulating PDF files. Poppler is a fork of this software, which adds a number of unique tools that are not part of the original Xpdf package. The tools included with Poppler are:

- **pdfdetach**: lists or extracts embedded files (attachments)
- **pdffonts**: analyzes fonts
- **pdfimages**: extracts images
- **pdfinfo**: displays document information
- **pdfseparate**: page extraction tool
- **pdfsig**: verifies digital signatures
- **pdftocairo**: converts PDF to PNG/JPEG/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG using the [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) graphics library
- **pdftohtml**: converts PDF to HTML
- **pdftoppm**: converts PDF to PPM/PNG/JPEG images
- **pdftops**: converts PDF to PostScript (PS)
- **pdftotext**: text extraction tool
- **pdfunite**: document merging tool

The tools in Xpdf are largely identical, but don't include *pdfseparate*, *pdfsig*, *pdftocairo*, and *pdfunite*. Also, Xpdf has a separate *pdftopng* tool for converting PDF to PNG images (this functionality is covered by *pdftoppn* in the Poppler version). On Debian-based systems the Poppler tools are part of the package *poppler-utils*.

### Pdfcpu

[Pdfcpu](https://pdfcpu.io/) is a PDF processor that is written in the *Go* language. The documentation explicity mentions its main focus is strong support for batch processing and scripting via a rich command line. It supports all PDF versions up to PDF 1.7 (ISO-32000).

### Apache PDFBox

[Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents. It includes a set of [command-line tools](https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/commandline.html) for various PDF processing tasks. Binary distributions (as [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) packages) are available [here](https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.html) (you'll need the "standalone" JARs).

### QPDF

[QPDF](http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/) is "a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations on PDF files".

### MuPDF

[MuPDF](https://www.mupdf.com/) is "a lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer". It includes the [mutool](https://www.mupdf.com/docs/index.html) utility, which can do a number of PDF processing tasks.

### Ghostscript

[Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) is "an interpreter for the PostScript language and PDF files". It provides rendering to a variety of raster and vector formats.  

The remaining sections of this post are dedicated to specific tasks. As you will see, many of these can be addressed using the multi-tools listed in this section.

## Validate / test integrity of PDF document

PDFs that are damaged, structurally flawed or otherwise not conformant to the PDF format specification can result in a multitude of problems. A number of tools provide error checking and integrity testing functionality. This can range from limited structure checks, to full (claimed) validation against the filespec. It's important to note that none of the tools mentioned here are perfect, and some faults that are picked up by one tool may be completely ignored by another one and vice versa. So it's often a good idea to try multiple tools.

### Validate with Pdfcpu

The Pdfcpu command-line tool has a [`validate` command](https://pdfcpu.io/core/validate) that checks a file's compliance against [PDF 32000-1:2008](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf) (i.e. the ISO version of PDF 1.7). It provides both a "strict" and a "relexed" validation mode, where the "relaxed" mode (which is the default!) ignores some common violations of the PDF specification. The command-line is:

```bash
pdfcpu validate whatever.pdf
```

The "strict" mode can be activated with the `-m` option:

```bash
pdfcpu validate -m strict whatever.pdf
```

### Validate with JHOVE

[JHOVE](http://jhove.openpreservation.org/) is a is a file format identification, validation and characterisation tool that includes a module for PDF validation. It is widely used in the digital heritage (libraries, archives) sector. Here's a typical command-line example (note that you explicitly need to invoke the *PDF-hul* module via the `-m` option; omitting this can give unexpected results):

```bash
jhove -m PDF-hul -i whatever.pdf
```

Check out the [documentation](https://jhove.openpreservation.org/modules/pdf/) for more information about JHOVE's PDF module, and its limitations.

### Check integrity with QPDF 

The `--check` option of QPDF (see above) performs checks on a PDF's overall file structure. QPDF does not provide full-fledged validation, and the [documentation](http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/files/qpdf-manual.html) states that:

> A file for which --check reports no errors may still have errors in stream data content but should otherwise be structurally sound

Nevertheless, QPDF is still useful for detecting various issues, especially in conjunction with the `--verbose` option. Here's an example command-line:

```bash
qpdf --check --verbose whatever.pdf
```

### Check for Ghostscript rendering errors

Another useful technique is to process a PDF with Ghostscript (rendering the result to a "nullpage" device). For example: 

```bash
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=nullpage whatever.pdf
```

In case of any problems with the input file, Ghostscript will report quite detailed information. As an example, here's the output for a PDF with a truncated document trailer:

```
   **** Error:  An error occurred while reading an XREF table.
   **** The file has been damaged.  This may have been caused
   **** by a problem while converting or transfering the file.
   **** Ghostscript will attempt to recover the data.
   **** However, the output may be incorrect.
   **** Warning:  There are objects with matching object and generation
   **** numbers.  The output may be incorrect.
   **** Error:  Trailer dictionary not found.
                Output may be incorrect.
   No pages will be processed (FirstPage > LastPage).

   **** This file had errors that were repaired or ignored.
   **** Please notify the author of the software that produced this
   **** file that it does not conform to Adobe's published PDF
   **** specification.
```

### Check for errors with Mutool info command

Running Mutool (part of MuPDF, see above) with the `info` command returns information about internal pdf resources. In case of broken or malformed files the output includes error messages, which can be quite informative. Here's an example command-line:

```bash
mutool info whatever.pdf 
```

### Other options

- [VeraPDF](https://verapdf.org/) can provide useful information on damaged or invalid PDF documents. However, VeraPDF is primarily aimed at validation against [PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) and [PDF/UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/UA) profiles, which are both subsets of [ISO 32000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (which defines the PDF format's full feature set). As a result, VeraPDF's validation output can be somewhat difficult to interpret for "regular" PDFS (i.e. documents that are not PDF/A or PDF/UA). Nevertheless, experienced users may find VeraPDF useful for such files as well.

- Several online resources recommend the *pdfinfo* tool that is part of Xpdf and Poppler for integrity checking. However, while writing this post I ran a quick test of the tool on a PDF with a truncated document trailer[^1] (which is a very serious flaw), which was not flagged by *pdfinfo* at all.  

## Validate compliance with PDF/A or PDF/UA

[PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) comprises a set of ISO-standardized profiles that are aimed at long-term preservation. [PDF/UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/UA) is another ISO-standardized profile that ensures accessibility for people with disabilities. These are not separate file formats, but rather profiles within ISO 32000 that put some constraints on PDF's full set of features.

### Validate PDF/A or PDF/UA with VeraPDF

[VeraPDF](https://verapdf.org/) was originally developed as an open source PDF/A validator that  covers all parts of the PDF/A standards. Starting with version 1.18, it also added support for PDF/UA. The following command lists al available validation profiles:

```bash
verapdf -l
```

Result:

```
  1a - PDF/A-1A validation profile
  1b - PDF/A-1B validation profile
  2a - PDF/A-2A validation profile
  2b - PDF/A-2B validation profile
  2u - PDF/A-2U validation profile
  3a - PDF/A-3A validation profile
  3b - PDF/A-3B validation profile
  3u - PDF/A-3U validation profile
  ua1 - PDF/UA-1 validation profile
```

When running VeraPDF, use the `-f` (flavour) option to set the desired validation profile. For example, for PDF/A-1A use something like this[^2]:

```bash
verapdf -f 1a whatever.pdf > whatever-1a.xml
```

And for PDF/UA:

```bash
verapdf -f ua1 whatever.pdf > whatever-ua.xml
```

The [documentation](https://docs.verapdf.org/cli/validation/) provides more detailed instructions on how to use VeraPDF.

## Document information and metadata extraction

A large number of tools are capable of displaying or extracting technical characteristics and various kinds of metadata, with varying degrees of detail. I'll only highlight a few here.

### Extract general characteristics with Pdfinfo

The *pdfinfo* tool that is part of Xpdf and Poppler is useful for a quick overview of a document's general characteristics. The basic command line is:

```bash
pdfinfo whatever.pdf
```

Which gives the following result:

```

### Elaborate feature extraction with VeraPDF

Although primarily aimed at PDF/A validation, [VeraPDF](https://verapdf.org/) can also be used as a powerful metadata and feature extractor for any PDF file (including files that don't follow the PDF/A or PDF/UA at all!). By default, VeraPDF is configured to only extract metadata from a PDF's information dictionary, but this behaviour can be easily changed by modifying a configuration file, which is [explained in the documentation](https://docs.verapdf.org/cli/config/#features.xml). This enables you to obtain detailed information about things like Actions, Annotations, colour spaces, document security features (including encryption), embedded files, fonts, images, and much more. Then use a command line like[^3]:

```
verapdf --off --extract whatever.pdf > whatever.xml
```

VeraPDF can also be used to recursively process all files with a .pdf extension in a directory tree, using the following command-line (here, *myDir* is the root of the directory tree):

```
verapdf --recurse --off --extract myDir > whatever.xml
```

The [VeraPDF documentation](https://docs.verapdf.org/cli/feature-extraction/) discusses the feature extraction functionality in more detail.

## Assess compliance with user-defined policy or profile

The results of the feature extraction exercise described in the previous section can also be used as input for policy-based assessments. For instance, archival institutions may have policies that prohibit e.g. PDFs with encryption or fonts that are not embedded.

### VeraPDF policy assessment

Automated assessment of PDFs against such policies can also be done with VeraPDF. This requires that the rules that make up the policy are expressed as a machine-readable [Schematron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematron) file. As an example, the Schematron file below is made up of two rules that each prohibit specific encryption-related features:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<sch:schema xmlns:sch="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron" queryBinding="xslt">
    <sch:pattern name="Disallow encrypt in trailer dictionary">
        <sch:rule context="/report/jobs/job/featuresReport/documentSecurity">
            <sch:assert test="not(encryptMetadata = 'true')">Encrypt in trailer dictionary</sch:assert>
        </sch:rule>
    </sch:pattern>    
    
    <sch:pattern name="Disallow other forms of encryption (e.g. open password)">
        <sch:rule context="/report/jobs/job/taskResult/exceptionMessage">
            <sch:assert test="not(contains(.,'encrypted'))">Encrypted document</sch:assert>
        </sch:rule>
    </sch:pattern>
    
</sch:schema>
```

A PDF can subsequently be tested against these rules (here in the file "policy.sch") using the following basic command-line:

```bash
verapdf --extract --policyfile policy.sch whatever.pdf > whatever.xml
```

The outcome of the policy-based assessment can be found in the output file's *policyReport* element. In the example below, the PDF did not meet one of the rules:

```xml
<policyReport passedChecks="0" failedChecks="1" xmlns:vera="http://www.verapdf.org/MachineReadableReport">
    <passedChecks/>
    <failedChecks>
        <check status="failed" test="not(encryptMetadata = 'true')" location="/report/jobs/job/featuresReport/documentSecurity">
            <message>Encrypt in trailer dictionary</message>
        </check>
    </failedChecks>
</policyReport>
```

More examples can be found in my 2017 post [Policy-based assessment with VeraPDF - a first impression]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2017/06/01/policy-based-assessment-with-verapdf-a-first-impression).

## Extract text

<https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer/>

### Extract text with PDFBox

Example command (you may need to adapt the path to the JAR file and its name according to the location and version on your system):

```bash
java -jar ~/pdfbox/pdfbox-app-2.0.24.jar ExtractText whatever.pdf whatever.txt
```

## Compare two PDFs

Sometimes it's useful to be able to check if two PDF documents contain the same text, or if they have the same visual appearance.

### Comparepdf 

The [Comparepdf](http://www.qtrac.eu/)[^4] tool compares PDFs, based on either text or visual appearance. By default it uses the program exit code to store the result of the comparison. The tool's command-line help text explains the possible outcomes:

> A return value of 0 means no differences detected; 1 or 2 signifies an error; 10 means they differ visually, 13 means they differ textually, and 15 means they have different page counts

For clarity I used the `-v` switch in the examples below, which activates verbose output. To test if two PDFs contain the same text, use:

```bash
comparepdf -ct -v=2 whatever.pdf wherever.pdf
```

If al goes well the output is either "No differences detected" or "Files have different texts".

To compare the visual appearance of two PDFs, use:

```bash
comparepdf -ca -v=2 whatever.pdf wherever.pdf
```

In this case the output either shows "No differences detected" or "Files look different".

[^1]: Command line: `pdfinfo whatever.pdf`

[^2]: In this example output is redirected to a file; this is generally a good idea because of the amount of XML output generated by VeraPDF.

[^3]: The `--off` switch disables PDF/A validation. Output is redirected to a file (recommended because, depending on the configuration used, VeraPDF can generate a *lot* of output).

[^4]: On Debian-based systems you can install it using `sudo apt install comparepdf`.
