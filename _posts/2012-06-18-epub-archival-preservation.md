Over the last few years, the [*EPUB*][EPUB] format has gained widespread popularity in the consumer market. The [KB] has been approached by a number of publishers that wish to use *EPUB* for delivering some of  their electronic publications. Surprisingly little information is available on the format's suitability for archival preservation, apart from Library of Congress' [*Sustainability of Digital Formats*] [formatsLOC] web pages, which contain entries on [*EPUB* 2][epub2LOC] and [*EPUB* 3][epub3LOC].

So, the KB's Departments of Collection and Collection Care requested a more detailed investigation of *EPUB*'s preservation credentials. More specifically, answers were needed to the following questions:

+ What are the main characteristics of EPUB?

+ What functionality does EPUB provide, and is this sufficient for representing e.g. content with sophisticated layout and typography requirements?

+ How well is the *EPUB* supported by software tools that are used in (pre-)ingest workflows?

+ How suitable is *EPUB*  for archival preservation? What are the main risks?

## EPUB for archival preservation

The [report *EPUB for archival preservation*][epubPreservation] is a first attempt at answering these questions as well as possible. It starts out with a simple example that illustrates the general structure of an EPUB file, followed by a more in-depth discussion on of specific aspects of the format. It then covers functionality-related aspects such as layout, appearance and multimedia support, and the main differences between *EPUB* 2 and *EPUB* 3.

Support by characterisation tools is important for processing *EPUB* files in an operational workflow, so a brief review (and some preliminary tests) of relevant identification, validation and feature extraction tools is included as well.

To assess the overall suitability of *EPUB* for preservation, the format was evaluated against a set of widely used criteria (mainly from The National Archives and Library of Congress). The final chapter wraps up the main conclusions, and suggests a number of recommendations.

## Community input

Since it appears that not much has been published on *EPUB* within an archival preservation context so far, we would really appreciate to hear your thoughts on the report. Is anything important missing? Did I overlook any relevant tools? Is there anything in particular that you strongly disagree with? Please use the comment fields below to let us know!

In addition, the final chapter contains two subsections with *Community Recommendations* and *Tool Recommendations*. These are all things we can do as a community to simplify the use of *EPUB* in archival settings. Please consider getting involved if you feel you could make a contribution.
