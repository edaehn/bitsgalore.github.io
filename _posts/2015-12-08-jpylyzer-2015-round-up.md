Yesterday (7 December)  we released [version 1.16.0](http://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org//2015/12/07/Release-of-jpylyzer-1-16-0) of the [*jpylyzer*](http://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org/) tool, which is this year's third release of the software (excluding bugfix releases). This blog post gives a brief overview of the main *jpylyzer* improvements that have been implemented over this year.

## Changes in XML output

The 1.14 release introduced two output improvements. Most importantly, an [XML Schema Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29) (XSD) was created. The schema formally defines the output format, and it also makes it possible to validate output files. In addition, a namespace declaration was added. These changes make the post-processing of *jpylyzer*'s output more straightforward.

The 1.16 release added the *statusInfo* element, which tells you whether the validation completed without any internal errors. It contains the following sub-elements:

* *success*: a Boolean flag that indicates whether the validation attempt 
completed normally (“True”) or not (“False”). A value of “False” indicates
an internal error that prevented *jpylyzer* from validating the file. 

* *failureMessage*: if the validation attempt failed (value of *success* 
equals “False”), this field gives further details about the reason of the failure.

This means that the general structure of the output now looks like this:

## Recursive traversal of directory trees

Another feature that was introduced  with the 1.14 release is the `--recurse` option. This allows one to recursively traverse a directory tree. The code for this feature was created by Adam Retter, Jaishree Davey and Laura Damian of The National Archives (UK).

## Memory mapping

The 1.15 release introduced the use of [memory mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) for reading input images. This results in better performance when processing (very) large files. Images that would cause a memory error in previous versions are now handled without any problem. Also, the processing of very large files can be significantly faster than in earlier releases, and is less prone to freezing other processes that are simultaneously running on the machine. This improvement was suggested by Stefan Weil of Mannheim University Library, and the changes are based on a patch he submitted.

Two examples illustrate the benefits of this change:

* [This 2 GB image](http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/download/PDS/RDR/ESP/ORB_011200_011299/ESP_011265_1560/ESP_011265_1560_RED.JP2)
 resulted in a memory error with *jpylyzer* 1.14.2 on a Windows machine with 4 GB RAM. The latest versions process the file without problems.

* On a Linux Mint machine with 8 GB RAM, [this 6.7 GB image](http://apollo.sese.asu.edu/data/pancam/AS16/jp2/AS16-P-4102.jp2)
 also resulted in a memory error. Again, the current version handles the file without any problem. 

This doesn't mean that memory errors are now a thing of the past entirely; they may still occur under some circumstances. For instance, a test with the 6.7 GB image failed on a Linux Mint machine with 4 GB RAM. So it seems prudent to make sure that the amount of available RAM always exceeds the maximum image size by a fairly wide safety margin. Also, chip architecture and operating system may put further constraints on the amount of memory than can be mapped at a time. 
 
## Improved exception handling

Prior to release 1.16.0, an exception during the processing of an image could cause *jpylyzer* to crash. For example, an extremely large image can result in an internal memory error, and this would grind *jpylyzer* to a halt. This is particularly problematic when using the new `--recurse` option: in this case a single *jpylyzer* invocation may involve the processing of thousands of images at a time. One single (e.g. extremely large) image could then result in unusable output; moreover, it would be difficult to identify *which* image caused the crash in the first place! Release 1.16.0 introduces improved exception handling that allows *jpylyzer* to handle such situations more gracefully. 

## Robustness

The combined effect of the exception handling, memory mapping and status output should make *jpylyzer* releases from 1.16.0 onwards significantly more robust than previous versions. As an example, here's some (simplified) output for a 6.5 GB JP2 that caused a memory error:

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <jpylyzer>
        <toolInfo>
            <toolName>jpylyzer.py</toolName>
            <toolVersion>1.16.0</toolVersion>
        </toolInfo>
        <fileInfo>
            <fileName>AS16-P-4102.jp2</fileName>
            <filePath>/home/johan/testJpylyzer/AS16-P-4102.jp2</filePath>
            <fileSizeInBytes>6745365021</fileSizeInBytes>
            <fileLastModified>Wed Dec  2 20:05:29 2015</fileLastModified>
        </fileInfo>
        <statusInfo>
            <success>False</success>
            <failureMessage>memory error (file size too large)</failureMessage>
        </statusInfo>
        <isValidJP2>False</isValidJP2>
        <tests/>
        <properties/>
    </jpylyzer>

Previous versions would simply crash in this situation. Now, automated workflows can simply check for the value of the *success* field to verify the status of the validation. More importantly, if the *jpylyzer* invocation involved multiple input files (e.g. through the `--recurse` option), errors like these will not stop the processing of the remaining files. 

## 64-bit Windows binaries

Finally, from version 1.15.1 onwards we are now providing 64 bit Windows binaries of *jpylyzer* (previously only 32-bit binaries were available).
