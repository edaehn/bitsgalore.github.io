Back in 2006, Dutch weblog [Sargasso](http://sargasso.nl/) started following the activity of about 260 Dutch blogs that were active at the time, mainly by looking at the frequency of new postings. <!-- more --> Earlier this week Sargasso [published an update of the the status of these blogs in 2014](http://sargasso.nl/battle-blogs-war-lost/). They summarised the results of their analysis with this fascinating visualisation:

Each block in the figure represents one blog, where the color and the number of dots indicate how often new postings appear. Here's the legend:

|Symbol|Posting frequency|
|:--|:--|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf1k1.png)|High|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf2k1.png)|Occasional gaps|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf3k1.png)|Gaps of one or more days|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf4k1.png)|Lots of large gaps|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf5k1.png)|Almost dead|
|![](http://www.sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bf6k1.png)|Casualty of war|

The really outstanding feature here is that most of these blogs are now in the "casualty of war" category. They're simply *gone*; the URLs either don't work, or they link to a completely different website. A pretty dramatic demonstration of the importance of web archiving if you ask me.
