And there you have it, the launch of [bitsgalore.org](http://www.bitsgalore.org/). And what better way to inaugurate this blog than with this fine selection of festive music. I compiled *Super Sounds of Christmas* over a year ago, but it still sounds pretty good to me.

Style-wise it's all over the place: there's seventies disco (including an amazing track by the Salsoul Orchestra), exotica, reggae, polka, a truck-driving song by Red Simpson, a glass harp rendition of *Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy*, eighties *MIDI* madness from Finland, and even a  Klaus Wunderlich track. And then some.

This mix was loosely inspired by the annual Christmas mix CDs by the inimitable Jonny Trunk, and if you enjoyed *Super Sounds of Christmas*, chances are you will like his mixes as well (if not even more). The latest instalment is available  from his [Trunkshoppe](http://trunkrecords.greedbag.com/buy/xmas-suckers-mix/); stocks usually run out pretty fast, so get one there while you can. In the meantime, here's *Super Sounds of Christmas*!
