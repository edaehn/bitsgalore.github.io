This will be my shortest blog post ever. Following up on [my previous
blog post on a prototype JP2 validator and properties
extractor]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2011/12/14/prototype-jp2-validator-and-properties-extractor)
(jpylyzer), there is now a comprehensive User Manual of the tool. Just
follow the link below:

Meanwhile work on *jpylyzer* remains ongoing, so watch this space for
any updates on this.

**Update February 2019**: updated links in original blog post
