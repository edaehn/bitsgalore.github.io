title: Roll the tape - recovering '90s data tapes in BitCurator
tags: [tapes,tapeimgr,web-archaeology]
---

When the [KB web archive](https://www.kb.nl/en/organisation/research-expertise/long-term-usability-of-digital-resources/web-archiving) was launched in 2007, many sites from the "early" Dutch web had already gone offline. As a result, the time period between (roughly) 1992 and 2000 is seriously under-represented in our web archive. To improve the coverage of web sites from this historically important era, we are now looking into [Web Archaeology](https://hart.amsterdam/image/2016/11/28/20160730_redds_tjardadehaan.pdf) tools and methods. Over the last year our web archiving team has reached out to creators of "early" Dutch web sites that are no longer online. It's not uncommon to find that these creators still have boxes of offline carriers with the original source data of those sites. Using these data, we would (in many cases) be able to reconstruct the sites, similarly to how we [reconstructed the first Dutch web index]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2018/04/24/resurrecting-the-first-dutch-web-index-nl-menu-revisited) last year. Once reconstructed, they could then be ingested into our web archive.

## Physical carrier formats

At this early stage of the web archaeology project, a few site creators have already loaned us sample sets of offline carriers. Even though these sets are limited in size, they already contain quite a wide range of physical formats: CD-ROMs, floppy disks, ZIP disks, USB thumb drives, (internal) hard disks, and a variety of tape formats. For reading the data on these carriers, we've set up a desktop workstation running the [*BitCurator*](https://bitcurator.net/) environment.

## Tapes

One of the first sample sets we received contains a collection of over 30 data tapes from the mid to late '90s. Roughly half of these are [*DDS-1*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Data_Storage) tapes, a format based on [*Digital Audio Tape*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Tape). The other half are *DLT-IV* tapes, a type of [*Digital Linear Tape*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Linear_Tape). The remainder of this blog post explains how we set up a workflow for reading these tapes. It also highlights some of the particular challenges we encountered along the way, and gives some (hopefully useful) hints and suggestions for others who are interested in setting up a similar workflow.

## Tape drives

Obviously, to read these vintage tape formats you first need tape drives that support them. Luckily, our IT department turned out to have a working *DDS-2* drive (which also reads *DDS-1* tapes), as well as a *DLT-IV* drive tucked away on a shelf.

## SCSI madness

Since tape drives typically use [parallel *SCSI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI) connectors, hooking them up to a modern PC is not straightforward, and requires the installation of a [*SCSI* host adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_host_adapter) (AKA *SCSI* controller). Although used ones are available cheap online, choosing the right one can be tricky. Many older models are [*conventional PCI cards*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI), which are not compatible with most modern motherboards (which these days are more likely to have [*PCI Express*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) slots). Also, beware that many *SCSI* adapters have a 64-bit *PCI* interface, which is only compatible with enterprise servers[^1]. Since online sellers often don't mention the interface type, [this website with Adaptec *SCSI* Card Specifications](https://storage.microsemi.com/en-us/support/scsi/) is a useful resource for checking potential compatibility issues.

In addition, rather than being one well-defined standard, parallel *SCSI* is really a hot mess of different standards that use different interfaces and connector types. Not all of these interfaces and connectors are mutually compatible, and interface mismatches [can result in actual hardware damage](https://twitter.com/charles_forsyth/status/1004356758893154305). The Wikipedia entry on parallel *SCSI* [contains some useful information on compatibility issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI#Compatibility); a more [in-depth discussion can be found here](http://www.paralan.com/scsiexpert.html). The same web site (a treasure trove of all things *SCSI*) also has this [illustrated overview of the most common connector types](http://www.paralan.com/sediff.html), which I found immensely helpful for identifying the connector types of our tape drives. Because of the myriad *SCSI* connector types, you may also need adapter plugs or cables to connect the tape drive to the *SCSI* controller (in our case we used [this adapter plug](https://web.archive.org/web/20181002103944/https://www.ramelectronics.net/sm-044-r.aspx) to connect the 68-pin high-density cable of our *DDS* drive to *SCSI* controller's *VHCDI* connector). Finding matching cables and adapters can be quite a challenge, not least because multiple names are used for most *SCSI* connector types. For instance, the commonly used 68-pin "DB68" connector is also known as "MD68", "High-Density", "HD 68", "Half-Pitch" and "HP68". Aaargh!

Another thing to keep in mind is that any unused *SCSI* buses on the tape drive must be fitted with a [terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI#Termination), so if your drive doesn't have one already you'll have to track down a matching type.

## Tapeimgr software

With the *SCSI* controller inserted into our *BitCurator* workstation, I hooked up one of the tape drives, and tried to read some test tapes[^2]. Since we want to read the tape data in a format-agnostic way that is independent of the software that was originally used to write the tapes, I used Unix [*dd*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29) (and the [*mt*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mt) tool to issue tape transport commands). After some experimentation, I was able to write a simple Bash script that sequentially reads all files on the tape. I then rewrote the script into what was to become the [*tapeimgr*](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/tapeimgr) software. *Tapeimgr* (which was loosely inspired by the [*Guymager*](https://guymager.sourceforge.io/) software) allows one to read data from a tape using a simple and user-friendly graphical interface. Internally, *tapeimgr* just wraps around *dd* and *mt*, but the complexities of these tools are hidden from the user. For a given tape, the software reads all files; before reading a file, it first runs an iterative procedure to establish the block size that was used for writing it. Once the end of a tape is reached, *tapeimgr* computes *SHA512* checksums of all recovered files, and these are subsequently written to a .json file (alongside some basic descriptive and event metadata). A detailed extraction log with the full output of *dd* is also written for each tape.

## Post-processing

Since *tapeimgr* is format-agnostic, it's up to the user to figure out how to further process the recovered files. Identifying the file format is the first step, and this can be done using the usual suspects such as Unix [*file(1)*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file), [*Siegfied*](https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried/) (both accessible through right-click context menus in *BitCurator*). Once the format is known, format-specific tools (e.g. [*tar*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tar)) can be used to extract the files' contents.

## Recovering the first sample set

After we were confident that our tape processing workflow worked correctly, we used it to process the sample set of *DDS* and *DLT-IV* tapes that were loaned to us. The majority of the 19 *DDS* tapes in the sample set could be read without problems. Only 3 tapes resulted in any issues. Two tapes could not be read at all; both of them turned out to be *DDS-3* tapes, which are not supported by the *DDS-2* tape drive we used. A *DDS-3* or *DDS-4* drive should be able to read these tapes. For one other tape the extraction resulted in a 10-kB file with only null bytes, which most likely means the tape is faulty. Of the 14 *DLT-IV* tapes, 7 could be read without problems. For the remaining 7, the reading procedure only resulted in a zero-length file. Interestingly, a common characteristic of all "failed" tapes is that they were written at 40.0 GB capacity, whereas the other tapes were written at 35.0 GB capacity. This is odd, as our *DLT-IV* drive *does* support 40.0 GB capacity tapes (which was confirmed by writing some data to a blank test tape at 40.0 GB capacity, which could subsequently be read without problems). This needs some further investigation.

## Next steps

The next step (which we haven't started yet) is to extract the contents of the recovered files. A cursory look suggests that most recovered files in our sample set use the [Unix *dump* format](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Unix_dump), which can be opened and extracted relatively easily. There are also some [*tar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) archives, which are even easier to extract. Once that is done, the real job of reconstructing the web sites that they contain can start, but that will be a different story altogether.
