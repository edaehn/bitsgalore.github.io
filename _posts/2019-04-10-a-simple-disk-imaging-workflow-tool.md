As I explained in the introduction of [this earlier blog post]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2019/01/31/roll-the-tape-recovering-90s-data-tapes-in-bitcurator), as part of our ongoing web archaeology project we are currently developing workflows for reading data from a variety of physical carrier formats. After the earlier work on [data tapes]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2019/01/31/roll-the-tape-recovering-90s-data-tapes-in-bitcurator) and [optical media]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2019/03/22/a-simple-workflow-tool-for-imaging-optical-media-using-readom-and-ddrescue), the next job was to image a small box with 3.5" floppy disks. Easy enough, and my first thought was to fire up [*Guymager*](https://guymager.sourceforge.io/) and be done with it. This turned out to be less straightforward than expected, which led to the development of yet another workflow tool: [*diskimgr*](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/diskimgr). In the remainder of this post I will first show the issues I ran into with *Guymager*, and then demonstrate how these issues are remedied by *diskimgr*.

## Guymager workflow

As I tried to image some floppies with *Guymager*, I quickly ran into several problems, all of which involved the handling of user-added descriptive metadata. *Guymager* does in fact accommodate for this, but the way it is implemented introduces some practical issues. To illustrate this, here's *Guymager*'s default entry form: 

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/guymager-entry.png" alt="Screenshot of Guymager entry form, Expert Witness format">
  <figcaption>Guymager entry form, Expert Witness format</figcaption>
</figure>

The form provides various fields that can be used to enter descriptive metadata, but they are *only* available if one chooses to write the disk image in [*Expert Witness Format*](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000406.shtml). Changing the format to *Linux dd raw image* (which simply generates a raw copy of the imaged medium's bytestream) disables these fields:

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/guymager-dd.png" alt="Screenshot of Guymager entry form, dd format">
  <figcaption>Guymager entry form, dd format</figcaption>
</figure>

## Expert Witness Format

One possible solution would be to image the floppies to *Expert Witness Format* (*EWF*), in which case the entered descriptor fields are embedded in the disk image. However, I really don't want to do this. First, saving to *EWF* would make further processing of the disk image (e.g. mounting the file system, or attaching it to a virtual machine or emulator) more difficult, since it requires that the reading application (emulator, disk mount tool) supports not only the floppy's native file system (typically [*FAT*](https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/FAT) for floppies that were written with MS-DOS or Windows), but also the added *EWF* layer. Also, while *EWF*'s support for data compression can be  tremendously useful for imaging large hard disks, it is largely unnecessary for 1.5 MB floppies.

## Guymager metadata entry 

Last but not least, *Guymager*'s interface introduces another practical hurdle. When *Guymager* is launched, it shows a list of available devices: 

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/guymager-mainscreen.png" alt="Screenshot of Guymager startup screen with device list">
  <figcaption>Guymager startup screen with device list</figcaption>
</figure>

The user then selects the device they want to image, after which the aforementioned data entry form pops up. However, for floppies the descriptive metadata that one would enter here is typically found on the label on the floppy itself, *which by this time is inaccessible because the floppy is inside the floppy drive*!

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/floppy-label.jpg" alt="Photograph of floppy with descriptive information on label">
  <figcaption>Floppy with descriptive information on label</figcaption>
</figure>

Of course there are workarounds to this (e.g. you could copy the information from the labels beforehand, put it in a text file and then paste it into *Guymager*'s entry fields), but overall this would be pretty clumsy.

## Linux dd raw

An alternative solution would be to select the *Linux dd raw* option in *Guymager*, and then add the metadata by hand afterwards. Again (as I also argued in [my previous blog post]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2019/03/22/a-simple-workflow-tool-for-imaging-optical-media-using-readom-and-ddrescue)), this is pretty cumbersome, and prone to all sorts of errors.

## Diskimgr

As the [*omimgr*](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/omimgr) already solves the above problems for optical media, I simply used the code of *omimgr* as a starting point, and adapted it into [*diskimgr*](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/diskimgr). *Diskimgr* is a general-purpose disk imaging tool that can be used for a wide variety of digital media, such a floppy disks, USB Flash drives and hard disks. It provides a simple graphical user interface for the entry of descriptive metadata, and all entered and generated metadata are written to a *JSON* file, along with the image file.

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/diskimgr-1.png" alt="Screenshot of diskimgr interface">
  <figcaption>Diskimgr interface</figcaption>
</figure>

Internally *diskimgr* wraps around [*Unix dd*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dd) and [*ddrescue*](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ddrescue). The general workflow of *diskimgr* is similar to the one employed by *omimgr*: first it tries to read a user-defined medium with *dd*. If *dd* fails, it prompts the user to give it another try with *ddrescue*. If *ddrescue* was unable to recover all the data from the medium, additional *ddrescue* passes may be run to further improve the result. As an example, the screenshot below was taken after a *diskimgr* session with a damaged 3.5" floppy disk:

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2019/04/ddrescue-pass2.png" alt="Screenshot of diskimgr after two ddrescue passes">
  <figcaption>Diskimgr after two ddrescue passes</figcaption>
</figure>

After an initial attempt to image this floppy with *dd* failed with errors, a first pass with *ddrescue* resulted in a 106 kB block of unreadable data. A second *ddrescue* pass with the *Direct disc mode* option switched on reduced the size of the unreadable block to a mere 512 bytes (one sector).

## Metadata

Descriptive metadata, a SHA-512 checksum of the disk image, and a host of event metadata are written to a *JSON* file in a format that is largely identical to the one used by *omimgr*. Below is an example:

    {
        "acquisitionEnd": "2019-04-09T13:10:40.503984+02:00",
        "acquisitionStart": "2019-04-09T13:09:59.835833+02:00",
        "autoRetry": false,
        "blockDevice": "/dev/sdc",
        "checksumType": "SHA-512",
        "checksums": {
            "ks.img": "79a17d3fa536b8fa750257b01d05124dadb888f1171e9ca5cc3398a2c16de81b1687b52c70135b966409a723ef5f3960536a6e994847c5ebe7d5eaffefa62dc7"
        },
        "description": "KS metingen origineel",
        "diskimgrVersion": "0.1.0b3",
        "extension": "img",
        "identifier": "cc630cda-5ab7-11e9-bc82-dc4a3e5f53bf",
        "interruptedFlag": false,
        "maxRetries": "4",
        "notes": "",
        "prefix": "ks",
        "readCommandLine": "dd if=/dev/sdc of=/home/johan/test/6/ks.img bs=512 conv=notrunc",
        "readMethod": "dd",
        "readMethodVersion": "dd (coreutils) 8.25",
        "rescueDirectDiscMode": false,
        "successFlag": true
    }

## Main uses

While *diskimgr* can be used for virtually any kind of block device, including entire hard disks, it is not intended to be a full replacement for tools such as *Guymager*. For instance, for imaging a 500 GB hard disk I'd probably still prefer *Guymager*. However, for situations where one wants to image a large number of small-size media (such as floppies), *Guymager* is less than ideal, and *diskimgr* might be worth a try. It also provides a user-friendly alternative to using *dd* and *ddrescue* from the command-line.

## Final remarks

Just like *tapeimgr* and *omimgr*, *diskimgr* only works on Linux-based systems. Again, this is an initial release which has had limited testing, so use at your own risk. If you run into any issues, feel free to [report them here](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/diskimgr/issues).
